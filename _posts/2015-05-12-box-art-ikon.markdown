Visitors to the gallery are encouraged to take one, and to upload a photograph
to instagram with the hashtag `\#IWTCP` (Interlaken Watercolour Painting.)
All uploaders will be contacted and offered a free download of our next
release, along with other exclusive bonus material.

The aim of the project was to find a new way in which to communicate with a
set of people who have no knowledge of us as people, or of our music.
The reverse of each painting carries our soundcloud address. By taking the
time to hand-paint each card, we hope to show each recipient that their
attention is important to us.

When deciding where to install the box, we considered bookshops, caf√©s,
galleries, music stores etc. Finally, we decided that it would be nice to
place it in our home city of Birmingham, and from there, the Ikon was the
only choice. Located amongst cherry blossom trees, and by the canalside,
the Ikon is a refuge of peace in an otherwise busy city. The gallery itself
is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, so it seemed right to make
50 paintings to commemorate this important milestone. The Ikon continues
to be an important centre for exciting artists and artworks, and we hope
it continues to flourish for another 50 years.
